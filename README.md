# Introduction
Facial Recognition is the process of identifying a person through his or her facial features. We will be using thermal cameras to detect human faces. When we think about thermal images in the context of people, what usually comes to mind is night vision. The ability to see a person, or group of people, by the inevitable heat their bodies emit. 

An important aspect of our project requires us to understand that thermal images capture heat in the form of frequency of pixels, varying from 0 to 1. Studies have found that each face emits a unique heat signature due to the blood vessels below the skin, as mentioned by Barclay (2013). Therefore, thermal facial images capture unique individual facial heat signatures which mark as unique biomarkers, providing us with rich information to classify a person correctly using a model.

CRI stands for Color Rendering Index and is nothing but a specification of cameras which states how accurately artificial light shows colors of the people under them.

CRI AI Thermal camera is used to develop this project.
